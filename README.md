# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a requirement of the coding bootcamp course. I developed this study guide to fulfill the requirements of this course. It will serve as a study aid that I can refer that will reinforce my coding knowledge.  So far, I have learned to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Functions, and how to create a README file.

## Usage

Since this study guide contains notes on what I've learned, I can refer to and build on it.  For example, I will expand on each topic, and add new topics as I progress through the course. I may even change the title when necessary.
